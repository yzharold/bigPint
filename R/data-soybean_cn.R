#' @title Normalized soybean cotyledon data
#' @description This dataset contains normalized RNA-sequencing read counts from soybean cotyledon across three time stages of development. Early stage cotyledons were collected four days after planting and were green but closed. Middle stage cotyledons were collected while green and open, soon after the plant generated its first set of unifoliate leaves. Late stage cotyledons were collected immediately after the initiation of yellowing and shrinking.
